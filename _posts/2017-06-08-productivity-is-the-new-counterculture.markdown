I will try to start writing content daily as I get a better handle on blogging. For now, I'll start off with some observations on today's perceived "counterproductivity" culture and some advice for anybody that feels distracted.

"Distractions" are prevalent as ever in the information era. There is abundant evidence to show that [humans have a reduced attention span as a result of smartphones][1], but I find this anecdotally true as well. I love smartphones just as much as everybody else. But think about how your typical morning starts. What's the first thing you do?

Grab your smartphone, which is conveniently resting not too far from you.

Check your email.

Browse some insta memes.

Now an hour has gone by and you're still in bed. Has your day *actually* started?

I've started my days like that more often than I'd like to admit. If that's what a typical morning looks like for you, maybe it's time to start your morning on your own terms.

Starting your morning off by checking emails and browsing memes doesn't seem like anything inherently bad. But letting someone else take control of your morning *is*. I mean, it's your morning, you should be doing you. If that means checking your email first thing in the morning, then great. I think what happens to a lot of us is that once we start checking one email, we feel compelled to respond to others, and soon you've kinda wasted that fresh morning by not kicking off the morning the way you want to.

Ultimately, it boils down to productivity from the moment you wake to the moment you hit the sack.

It's not that people don't know what they *should* be doing, it's that they're constantly distracting themselves from what they want to accomplish. If this wasn't true, Netflix wouldn't be making money.

SO, I realize I'm sounding like a "holier-than-thou" Luddite right about now, but I still do this kind of stuff all the time. I get how easy it is to be distracted from things you want to be doing. Yes, it's difficult to stick to your higher goals, especially when you may not have the resources, willpower, or knowledge to accomplish them, but I promise that's another post. For now, here are some quick ways to eliminate distractions in your life and get you on your way to becoming a more productive you.

## Making lists

Seriously, lists helped me so much with accomplishing things I wanted to do. And this is a great way to use your phone in a productive manner. To explain how useful they are, think about the last time you forced yourself to do something. First, you had to remember it. 

*I have to remember to plan for my trip.*

If you're anything like me, you severely misunderestimate the amount of hours in a day, end up planning nothing and throwing your shit in a bag in a span of 10 minutes.

Lists force you to block out time for the specific activity.

"But I've tried lists before, and I wasn't any more productive!"

If that's you (me), try being more specific with yourself. When you tell yourself to "plan for your trip", you may be setting some unrealistic expectations on your future self by expecting him/her to basically "know" what to do at that point. What about that entire process of planning for your trip? Planning your departure, the route, mode of transportation, what exactly you want to pack, etc. The point is, any monumental task can be broken down into *smaller sublists*. Which also improves your internal dialogue!

## Improve your internal dialogue

If you've looked for advice pertaining to productivity, you've probably come across the general stuff that goes without saying, like having goals, having dreams, etc.

What I think is more important, however, is having a decent inner dialogue. What this comes down to is basically how you talk to yourself. Any time you force yourself to work for six hours straight without a break, you're guaranteed to only produce two hours' worth of quality content. How can you expect otherwise, when you're basically beating yourself into submission? It'd be unrealistic for your boss to put that kind of burden on you, let alone yourself. Forcing yourself to concentrate is definitely *not* the way to go--in fact, it makes things worse for you since you're constantly distracting yourself anyway.

By setting yourself up with realistic expectations of how much you can accomplish, it's much easier to stay productive. An easy way to start is by setting your work up in 30 minute blocks--25 minutes of work, followed by a five minute break. This is known as the [Pomodoro Technique][2].

What this also means is maybe doing fewer things in a day. Which doesn't sound like it makes sense at first. How can doing fewer things equate to higher productivity? But try this: use that Pomodoro Technique and only work for two good hours, free of distractions. See how much more productive you are?

## Meditation

Meditation is a solid way to [improve your attention span][3] by giving it a break from everything. Find a nice and quiet place to sit, set a timer for 15 minutes, close your eyes and try your best to concentrate on just your breathing. If you find your mind wandering, return to focusing on your breathing. The whole point is to foster mindfulness, so don't worry about "doing it right", as you really can't mess it up as long as you're just chilling. Try meditation, it's good for you even beyond just productivity and attention span.

## Conclude

Those are some simple tips for anyone trying to improve their productivity. These rules are, of course, not hard and fast. Make them work for you. Email me at robert@wong.fi with tips of your own or questions. I love having things to talk about.
