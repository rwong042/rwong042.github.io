Today it's easier to be hated than celebrated.

Or maybe they're the same thing.

Today's technology has made it so easy to create
 and spread content that the focus is no longer on the material itself,
 but the reactions that content illicits.

To be hated is essentially to be celebrated.

In the wake of xxxtentacion's death last month, many were understandably
 upset at an artist's death. But I cannot remember the last time someone
 reacted positively towards another person's passing.

It is easy for us to forget that at the end of the day, a 20 year old was shot dead.

I am not saying that what X did in the past was justified, or that his music made
 up for the things that he did and/or may have done. But we must remember that
 despite his art being, by it's very nature, controversial, X was an individual,
 and all individuals make mistakes. I doubt many of us made responsible choices
 at 20, but it gets easier for us to criticize people, especially artists, when
 their entire lives are brought into the limelight for us to scrutinize.

Being hated has become so marketable in today's clickbait culture. Sometimes
 artists or content creators may not even intend to be hated. But, at the
 end of the day, the art is the art, and the individual is still an individual
 no matter how much we may think otherwise.

The perception of artists in today's society has, without a doubt, been
 influenced by not only the content they create, but the manner in which
 it is distributed. We saw the way the media reacted to Kanye West's comments.
 The reaction to X's death is no different. The artist and the art have become
 conflated.

Ultimately, the way in which X rose to fame was through notoriety. Understandably,
 that marketing campaign carried through up until he died. To the fans of X, the
 ones who felt that his music meant something to them personally, his death
 was an absolute tragedy. To others, X does not represent an individual. He
 represents the actions that he committed in the past, for right or wrong.
