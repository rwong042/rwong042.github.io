How much clickbait can I feasibly get away with when I think of titles?

So here we go on another deep college student thought-rant, backed up by barely any solid research and mostly just my opinions and observations. As with anything on the internet, take it with a grain of salt. But really, I hope some things speak to the audience, and hopefully you can relate to a bit of what I'm saying.

"Quitting," in my opinion, is a hard word to use when talking about video games, because it implies some sort of underlying addiction. Most of us are probably not addicted to video games, in the same way that we're not "addicted" to Netflix. We may spend a considerable amount of time doing any of these things, but does that mean we are addicted?

It's a good question to ask yourself sometimes. We know quite a bit about the [psychology of addiction][1], but the definition is where it gets tricky sometimes. Addiction to anything may not always manifest itself in destructive, obvious ways, as is the case with hard drugs like cocaine or heroin. And you might tell you aren't addicted to video games because it hasn't had a significant impact on your physical wellbeing, assuming that it hasn't, of course. If you're sitting down for hours on end playing Overwatch and neglecting your physical health as a result, then that is something you should probably address quickly.

What I'm specifically talking about are the lifestyle and mental impacts of excessively playing video games, the psychological basis for why video games attract players in the first place, and why we may think they are less harmful than they really are.

Assuming your physical health is fine, can you really objectivey assess your mental health? I mean, forget mental health, what about objectively assessing your lifestyle without video games? Maybe you can. Or, maybe you're like me, who played video games until four in the morning every weekend in middle school, spending almost all my free time playing video games, simply because it was "something to do". 

I don't blame kids for playing video games. I observe that many children feel dreadfully bored being stuck at home with nothing to do, and without the maturity to really set themselves to do things, they look for whatever is stimulating and latch on to that activity (These claims are one hundred percent science-based, by the way. Well maybe not one hundred percent, but I'm paraphrasing heavily here). So, video games become a habit without the individual even realizing it. 

A distinction should be drawn between *having fun* and *being happy*. And what it really comes down to is whether or not you're happy when you're playing video games. Video games are designed with visible progress, clear objectives, and continual rewards, which is what makes video games feel so good and rewarding even though you're not actually doing anything.

Now I feel as though I have to redeem myself, since many passionate gamers are reaching for their pitchforks at this point. Look, if video games are your way to wind down after a long day and you are happy while you are playing video games, then there is no need for you to stop playing video games. But, if video games are distracting you from what you want to actually be doing, or you're not having fun *or* feeling happy when you play, then perhaps it's time to take a break. Anybody who has come across the "toxic gamer" knows that this is true--an individual who is not only not having fun himself, but making the game worse for other individuals.

So, if you're that person who is spending *maybe* a little bit too much time playing video games, or taking the game a *bit* too seriously, it may be beneficial to consider changing your habits if video games simply *are that thing you do*. Turning around and examining one's habits is not an easy task, but I've outlined some strategies that you might use to tackle distractions in your life in my previous article, "Productivity is the new Counterculture". I hope that this has resonated with some readers, and hopefully you've found something useful.
